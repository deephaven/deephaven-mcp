# Windsurf file-based rule: Use 'uv run pytest' for unit tests
unit_test:
  runner: "uv run pytest"
  files:
    - "tests/**/*.py"
    - "src/**/*.py"
  description: |
    Always use 'uv run pytest' instead of 'pytest' directly for running unit tests in this repository. This ensures the correct environment and dependencies are used.
