description: Perform a basic review and cleanup
---

1. Perform a very thorough review of this file.
2. Review all of the pydocs to see if any can be improved.
3. Remove unused imports.
4. Do not remove TODOs without a very good reason.
5. Review logging to see where logging needs to be added and where log messages need to be made consistent with the rest of the project.
