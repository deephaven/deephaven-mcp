Create a plan for improving this markdown file.
1. Look for content that is missing from this file that needs to be added.  Use the source code as a reference.  If there is a conflict, the source code should be believed over the readme files.
2. Look for content that is factually incorrect and needs to be fixed.  Use the source code as a reference.  If there is a conflict, the source code should be believed over the readme files.
3. Improve the outline and organization for this document.
4. Reorganize the sections to match the new outline.
5. Make sure that all files are linked.  
6. Check all of the links in the document to make sure they are correct.  
7. Are there any products, websites, or services that are being used that should be linked?
8. How else can this document be improved?

When making documentation changes, only do major rewrites if they are necessary.  Do not make massive changes without a compelling reason.
