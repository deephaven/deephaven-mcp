name: Build and Publish MCP Docs Docker Image

# ============================================================================
# This workflow builds and publishes the mcp-docs Docker image to Google Artifact Registry,
# and redeploys the service using Terraform via admin/run_terraform.sh.
#
# Deephaven MCP Docs: Docker Build & Deploy Workflow
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys the MCP documentation Docker image to Google Cloud.
#
# ---
#
# Directory Structure:
# - Terraform and supporting scripts: admin/ (e.g., admin/run_terraform.sh, admin/terraform/)
# - .env is expected at the project root for local runs; in CI/CD, INKEEP_API_KEY is set via a GitHub secret.
#
# Service Account & Secrets Requirements:
# - A Google Cloud service account with the following roles (principle of least privilege):
#     * Artifact Registry Writer   - Push Docker images
#     * Artifact Registry Reader   - Pull Docker images
#     * Cloud Run Admin            - Deploy/update Cloud Run services
#     * Service Account User       - Use service account for deployments
#     * Storage Admin              - Manage GCS buckets for state/artifacts
# - Service account key JSON must be stored as the GitHub secret: GH_ACTION_GCLOUD_JSON
# - INKEEP_API_KEY must be stored as the GitHub secret: INKEEP_API_KEY
#
# ---
#
# Service Account Setup:
#
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
# 2. Create a new service account or select an existing one (e.g., deephaven-mcp-github-actions)
# 3. Click the three dots > Manage permissions
# 4. Go to "Keys" > "Add key" > "Create new key" > JSON
# 5. Download the JSON key file
#    **This file is highly sensitive. After uploading it as a GitHub secret, delete it from your local machine to prevent accidental exposure.**
# 6. Add the JSON file as the GitHub secret: GH_ACTION_GCLOUD_JSON
# 7. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
# 8. Click "Grant access", add the service account as "New principals", and assign the roles listed above.
#
# Note: If you rotate the key, update the GitHub secret immediately. Remove unused or old keys in the Google Cloud Console.
#
# ---
#
# Security Warning:
# - Never commit the service account key JSON to version control.
# - Store the key securely and rotate it regularly.
# - If you rotate the key, update the GitHub secret `GH_ACTION_GCLOUD_JSON` immediately.
# - Remove unused keys in the Google Cloud Console.
